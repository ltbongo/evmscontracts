# EVM Lottery Contracts Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was performed on the EVM Lottery system consisting of two main contracts:
- `evmslottery.sol` - Main lottery contract
- `evmslotteryfactory.sol` - Factory contract for deploying lottery instances

**Overall Risk Level: HIGH**

Multiple critical and high-severity vulnerabilities were identified that could lead to loss of funds, manipulation of lottery results, and contract malfunction.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Unprotected Initialize Function** (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:168-190`
```solidity
function initialize(...) public {
    require(!initialized, "Contract already initialized");
    // ... initialization logic
}
```
**Issue:** The `initialize` function has no access control, allowing anyone to initialize an uninitialized contract.
**Impact:** An attacker could initialize the contract with malicious parameters.
**Recommendation:** Add `onlyOwner` modifier or restrict access to factory contract only.

### 2. **Unprotected Test Function** (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:378-380`
```solidity
function setWinnerNumber(uint[6] calldata _manualnumbers) external {
    _lotteries[currentLotteryId].winningNumbers = _manualnumbers;        
}
```
**Issue:** Anyone can manipulate winning numbers through this test function.
**Impact:** Complete manipulation of lottery results, guaranteed wins for attackers.
**Recommendation:** Remove this function entirely for production or add strict access controls.

### 3. **Logic Error in Winner Counting** (HIGH)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:400-402`
```solidity
cat5Winners++;
_lotteries[currentLotteryId].c5Winners.add(player);  // ERROR: .add() on uint256
_tickets[i].status = TicketStatus.Category5;
```
**Issue:** Attempting to call `.add()` method on `uint256` variable instead of incrementing.
**Impact:** Contract will revert when counting winners, making lottery uncloseable.
**Recommendation:** Change to `_lotteries[currentLotteryId].c5Winners++;`

## High-Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. **Potential Gas Limit DoS in Winner Counting** (HIGH)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:383-440`
**Issue:** The `countWinners()` function iterates through all tickets without gas limit protection.
**Impact:** With enough tickets, the function could exceed block gas limit, making the lottery uncloseable.
**Recommendation:** Implement batched processing or set maximum ticket limits.

### 5. **Inconsistent Access Control** (HIGH)
**Location:** Multiple functions in `evmslottery.sol`
**Issue:** Functions allow access from `factoryWallet`, `factoryContract`, or owner without proper validation of these addresses.
**Impact:** If factory addresses are compromised, entire lottery system is at risk.
**Recommendation:** Implement proper role-based access control and validation.

### 6. **Missing VRF Fulfillment Check** (HIGH)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:360-368`
```solidity
function drawNumbers() external nonReentrant () {
    // ... access control
    uint256[] memory numArray = s_requests[lastRequestId].randomWords;
    // No check if VRF request was fulfilled
}
```
**Issue:** Function doesn't verify if Chainlink VRF request was actually fulfilled before using random numbers.
**Impact:** Could use empty array for random numbers, leading to predictable results.
**Recommendation:** Add `require(s_requests[lastRequestId].fulfilled, "VRF not fulfilled");`

## Medium-Severity Issues

### 7. **Hardcoded Return Value** (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:457`
```solidity
return false;
```
**Issue:** `countWinners()` function always returns `false` regardless of success.
**Impact:** Calling contracts cannot determine if operation succeeded.
**Recommendation:** Return meaningful success/failure status.

### 8. **Sequential Matching Logic** (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:390-397`
**Issue:** Winner matching breaks on first non-sequential match, potentially not matching intended lottery mechanics.
**Impact:** Users may not receive prizes for partial matches if numbers are not in sequence.
**Recommendation:** Clarify if sequential or any-position matching is intended.

### 9. **Integer Overflow Risk** (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:203-216`
**Issue:** Jackpot calculations use SafeMath inconsistently.
**Impact:** Potential overflow in jackpot calculations.
**Recommendation:** Use SafeMath consistently or upgrade to Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection.

### 10. **Factory Contract Method Calls** (MEDIUM)
**Location:** `evmslotteryfactory.sol:229-232`
```solidity
function setAllLotteryFees(uint256 _lotteryFee) public onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < deployedLotteries.length; i++) {
        evmslottery lottery = evmslottery(deployedLotteries[i]);
        lottery.setLotteryFee(_lotteryFee);  // Method may not exist
    }
}
```
**Issue:** Factory calls methods that may not exist in lottery contract.
**Impact:** Transaction failures when calling non-existent methods.
**Recommendation:** Ensure all called methods exist and handle failures gracefully.

## Low-Severity Issues

### 11. **Unused Variables** (LOW)
**Location:** `evmslottery.sol:194-201`
**Issue:** Several variables declared but not used in `openLottery()` function.
**Impact:** Wasted gas and code clarity.
**Recommendation:** Remove unused variables.

### 12. **Missing Input Validation** (LOW)
**Location:** Multiple functions
**Issue:** Missing validation for address parameters (zero address checks).
**Impact:** Potential loss of funds if sent to zero address.
**Recommendation:** Add zero address checks for critical addresses.

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Remove or properly secure the `setWinnerNumber` test function**
2. **Fix the logic error in winner counting (`.add()` issue)**
3. **Add access control to the `initialize` function**
4. **Add VRF fulfillment verification in `drawNumbers()`**

### Important Improvements:
1. Implement gas-efficient winner counting with batching
2. Add consistent SafeMath usage or upgrade Solidity version
3. Implement proper role-based access control
4. Add comprehensive input validation
5. Remove unused code and variables

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Test with maximum ticket scenarios to verify gas limits
2. Test all access control mechanisms
3. Test Chainlink VRF integration thoroughly
4. Perform integration tests between factory and lottery contracts

## Conclusion

The contracts contain several critical vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment. The most critical issues involve access control and logic errors that could lead to complete compromise of the lottery system. A thorough security review and testing cycle is recommended after implementing the suggested fixes.
